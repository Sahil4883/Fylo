<h2>Fylo</h2>

The Fylo is a cloud storage company's website 
This project is made as a challenge given by an awesome website https://www.frontendmentor.io/
The Website is fully responsive and can support all device screen.

What I've learned in this:

effective use of flex-direction:column/row/reverse-row;
I've learned that how the image is set as the background image and how to control it's scale.
I've also solved the challenges related to the responsiveness of the website.
I've learned how to use and change the properties of svg in this project.

I'm happy to complete this challenge and would appretiate any constructive critism on the same project:)
